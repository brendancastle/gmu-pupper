# PS4 parameters
ps4_color: { "red": 0, "blue": 0, "green": 255 }
ps4_deactivated_color: { "red": 0, "blue": 0, "green": 255 }

# Movement parameters
max_x_velocity: 0.4 # maximum forward/back velocity [m/s]
max_y_velocity: 0.3 # maximum sideways velocity [m/s]
max_yaw_rate: 2.0 # maximum yaw rate [rad/s]
default_z_ref: -0.14 # default standing height of the robot (negative b/c legs go underneath the robot) [m]
z_clearance: 0.04 # height to raise each foot every step [m]

# Gait timing parameters
overlap_time: 0.05 # amount of time all four legs are on the ground between steps [s]
swing_time: 0.05 # amount of time each leg is in the air between steps [s]

# Gait type parameters

# Each column dictates which feet should be on the ground (1) and which should be
# in the air (0) for that phase of the gait. For example, the 2nd column is [1, 0, 0, 1] which
# indicates that the front-right (0th) and back-left (3rd) feet should be on the ground, 
# and the the front-left (1st) and back-right (2nd) feet should be in the air.
